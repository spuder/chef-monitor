## Description

Monitor is a cookbook for monitoring services, using Sensu, a
monitoring framework. The default recipe installs & configures the
Sensu client (monitoring agent), as well as common service check
dependencies. The master recipe installs & configures the Sensu server,
API, Uchiwa (dashboard), & their dependencies (eg. RabbitMQ & Redis).
The remaining recipes are intended to put monitoring checks in place
in order to monitor specific services (eg. `recipe[monitor::redis]`).

Learn more about Sensu [Here](http://sensuapp.org/docs).

### THIS COOKBOOK SERVES AS AN EXAMPLE!!!

There are many ways to deploy/use Sensu and its dependencies, this
"wrapper" cookbook is opinionated, you may not agree with its approach
and choices. If this cookbook can serve as the base for your
monitoring cookbook, fork it :-)

## Requirements

Cookbooks:

- [Sensu](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/sensu)
- [Uchiwa](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/uchiwa)
- [sudo](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/sudo)

## Attributes

`node["monitor"]["master_address"]` - Bypass the chef node search and
explicitly set the address to reach the master server.

`node["monitor"]["environment_aware_search"]` - Defaults to false.
If true, will limit search to the node's chef_environment.

`node["monitor"]["use_local_ipv4"]` - Defaults to false. If true,

`node["monitor"]["additional_client_attributes"]` - Additional client
attributes to be passed to the sensu_client LWRP.

`node["monitor"]["default_handlers"]` - Default event handlers.

`node["monitor"]["metric_handlers"]` - Metric event handlers.

## Usage

Example: To monitor the Redis service running on a Chef node, include
"recipe[monitor::redis]" in its run list.

### Test Kitchen

The .kitchen.yml depends on librarian-chef. If using the chef-dk and you wish to test with test kitchen, you must install the gem first

     (sudo) chef gem install librarian-chef
     kitchen create
